<h2 id="How-vaccines-work">How vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have some <a href="#Side-effects-after-vaccination-are-normal">side effects after vaccination</a>. </p>



<h3>Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">safe</a> and <a href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">effective</a> in clinical trials. All COVID-19 vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">established</a> and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">new safety monitoring systems</a>. These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">facts about COVID-19 vaccines.</a></p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring</a>. Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects.</p>

 </p>
</div>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>In the rare case that you do still get COVID-19, the vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19</a>.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build immunity. COVID-19 can have <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">serious, life-threatening complications,</a> and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.</li></ul>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccination is an important tool to help us get back to normal.</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Read more at CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/vaccine-benefits.html">Benefits of Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</a>.</p>



<h2 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination">What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<p>How much protection COVID-19 vaccination provides under real-life conditions is still unknown. Even with a vaccine, you may still be able to spread COVID-19. It is important for everyone to continue using all the tools available to us to help stop this pandemic, like:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html">Staying home and isolating</a> from others when sick</strong></li><li>Wearing masks&nbsp;</li><li>Washing hands often</li><li>Social distancing and avoiding crowds&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Together, COVID-19 vaccination and taking <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html">steps to protect yourself and others</a> will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19. We need to understand more about the protection that vaccines provide before we change recommendations.</p>



<h3 id="Side-effects-after-vaccination-are-normal">Side effects after vaccination are normal</h3>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">What are the side effects of COVID-19 vaccine?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. The most common side effects are pain and swelling in the arm where you received the shot. In addition, you may have fever, chills, tiredness, and headache. They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">what to expect after getting vaccinated.</a></p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to <a href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System) or <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker).</p>



<h3>You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine</h3>



<p>The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19. If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Am I exempt from quarantine after I have my COVID-19 vaccination?</div>



<h3 class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Limited quarantine exemption if you’re vaccinated</h3>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Vaccinated people who have been exposed to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine</a> if they meet all of the following criteria, according to the CDC:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>Are fully vaccinated (it’s been 2 weeks or more since getting the second dose in a 2-dose series, or 2 weeks or more since getting one dose of a single-dose vaccine)</li><li>Are within 3 months of getting the last dose in the series</li><li>Have had no symptoms since the exposure</li></ul>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">People who do not meet all 3 of the above criteria should quarantine. Follow current <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">quarantine guidance</a>.</p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Fully vaccinated people who do not need to quarantine should still watch for <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#Coronavirus-symptoms">symptoms of COVID-19</a> for 14 days following an exposure. If they experience symptoms, they should be evaluated for COVID-19, including coronavirus testing if indicated. In addition, vaccinated people should continue to follow <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/symptoms-and-risks/#What-increases-your-risk-of-infection">current guidance</a> to protect themselves and others, including <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/travel/">travel recommendations</a>.</p>



<h3>Testing for COVID-19 during vaccine rollout</h3>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Did the testing and isolation requirements change for the people who got COVID-19 vaccines?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">It will take many months before enough people are fully vaccinated to stop the spread of COVID-19. Therefore, at this time, <strong>CDPH does not recommend changes to testing requirements for individuals, even those who have been fully vaccinated.</strong> As the science and evidence evolves, CDPH will issue updated guidance to reflect new information and data.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li><strong>Get tested:</strong> If you have symptoms or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19, you should get tested. This is true even after being vaccinated. <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/"><strong>Tests for COVID-19</strong></a><strong> work the same in vaccinated people as they do in unvaccinated people.</strong></li><li><strong>Testing keeps you, your family, and friends safe</strong><ul><li>There are usually no out-of-pocket costs to <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/Nearby/index.html?appid=43118dc0d5d348d8ab20a81967a15401">get tested</a> at state testing sites.</li><li>Test results are usually returned in no more than two days.</li><li>See <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/get-tested/">testing page</a> or call (833) 422-4255 to find a test site near you</li><li>Discuss your symptoms with your healthcare provider</li></ul></li><li>If your job requires it, you still need to get tested regularly, even if you had the vaccine</li></ul>

<h2 id="California-vaccines-dashboard"><strong>Vaccination progress dashboards</strong></h2>



<p>These dashboards make vaccination data transparent and accessible to all Californians. </p>



<p>The dashboards report vaccines administered by the county of residence. Where the county of residence was not reported, the county where vaccinated is used. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations because some out-of-state residents are vaccinated in California.</p>

<p>The distribution of first vaccine doses by race and ethnicity, age, and gender is shown below. Providing this information is voluntary and not required for vaccination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Initially, vaccination was limited to healthcare workers and long-term care residents. Hence the data reflects those populations more than other California residents. Data shows the cumulative total administered and is updated weekly on Thursdays.</p>

<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>Vaccination planning</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How are vaccines allocated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change. Local providers are required to place their orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Initial enrollment in the vaccination program is limited to sites selected by local health departments. Enrollment will open up to other providers as vaccine supply increases.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Providers enrolling in the program must be <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Authorized-Licensees.aspx">credentialed/licensed</a> in the jurisdiction where vaccination takes place, complete all <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVID-19VaccineTraining.aspx">required training</a>, and comply with federal and state requirements.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://eziz.org/covid/enrollment/">Find out more about the enrollment process and program requirements</a>.</p>



<h3>Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li><li>One dose for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Be sure to get the same COVID-19 vaccine the second time that you got the first time. These vaccines are not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccines. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h3>What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h3>Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li><li>If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>People who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated. People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The ingredients in currently available COVID-19 vaccines include mRNA, lipids, salts, sugars, and buffers. Buffers help maintain the stability of the pH solution. Vaccine ingredients can vary by manufacturer. To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html">Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html">Information about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had a severe allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.</li><li>If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp; Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in allergies and immunology to provide more care or advice.</li><li>People who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">an immediate or severe allergic reaction</a> to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html">considerations for people with underlying medical conditions.</a> Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can pregnant or breastfeeding women be vaccinated against COVID-19?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html">CDC recommends</a> that if you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it’s available to you. There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may also receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. There is no routine recommendation for taking a pregnancy test before you get a COVID-19 vaccine.If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talk with a healthcare provider to help you make an informed decision.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html">CDC recommends:</a></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should wait at least 10 days since the start of COVID-19 symptoms <strong>and </strong>satisfy<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if you recovered from a COVID-19 infection and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#">CDC recommends</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If a COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given within 14 days of another vaccine, you do not need to restart the COVID-19 vaccine series; you should still complete the series on schedule. When more data are available on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, the CDC may update this recommendation.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for children:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is for ages sixteen and above</li><li>Moderna vaccine is for ages eighteen and above</li><li>Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is for ages eighteen and above</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Clinical trials are ongoing to identify a safe vaccine for children.</p>



<h3>Vaccine choices</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Check with your health care provider about which vaccine they have available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government.&nbsp; Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them.</p>



<h3>Vaccine committees and workgroups</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is the state making vaccine decisions?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Drafting-Guidelines-Workgroup.aspx/">group of experts</a> and a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Community-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee.aspx/">group of community representatives</a> work together to make sure vaccine distribution is prioritized fairly.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> of experts to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This workgroup has confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA are safe and effective.</p>
