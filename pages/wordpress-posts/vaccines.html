<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="How-vaccines-work"/>



<h2>How vaccines work</h2>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How do COVID-19 vaccines work?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines teach our immune systems how to recognize and fight the virus that causes COVID-19. It typically takes a few weeks after vaccination for the body to build protection (immunity) against the virus. That means it is possible a person could still get COVID-19 just after vaccination, because the vaccine has not had enough time to build immunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the vaccine you got requires two shots, be sure to get both doses so it can work fully.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-safety">Vaccine safety&nbsp;</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA have been shown to be <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/vaccines/emergency-use-authorization-vaccines-explained">safe</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines">effective</a> in clinical trials. These vaccines were authorized only after it was found that they make it substantially less likely you’ll get COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">How effective are the COVID-19 vaccines?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The authorized vaccines are up to 95% effective against a person becoming ill with COVID-19.</p>



<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">The U.S. vaccine safety system ensures that all vaccines are as safe as possible. Learn how the federal government is working to <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety.html">ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines</a>.</p>



<h4>Safety monitoring after vaccination</h4>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">Millions of people in the United States have received COVID-19 vaccines. These vaccines have undergone the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history, using both <a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/">established</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">new safety monitoring systems</a>. These vaccines cannot give you COVID-19. Learn more <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/facts.html">facts about COVID-19 vaccines.</a></p>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/adverse-events.html">Results from monitoring efforts are reassuring</a>. Many people have reported only mild side effects after COVID-19 vaccination. Some people have no side effects.</p>



<h4>You cannot get COVID-19 from the vaccine</h4>



<p>The vaccines do not contain coronavirus and cannot give you COVID-19.</p>

<div style="display:none;" class="js-qa js-qa-question">Why should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</div>



<p class="js-qa js-qa-answer">COVID-19 vaccines are effective at keeping you from getting COVID-19. But they have other benefits, too:</p>



<ul class="js-qa js-qa-answer"><li>In the rare case that you do still get COVID-19, the vaccine may help keep you from getting seriously ill.&nbsp;</li><li>Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you, <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/index.html">particularly people at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19</a>.</li><li>COVID-19 vaccination is a safer way to help build immunity. COVID-19 can have <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">serious, life-threatening complications,</a> and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you.</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination"/>



<h2>What to expect after vaccination</h2>



<h3 id="You-may-have-mild-side-effects">You may have mild side effects</h3>



<p>After COVID-19 vaccination, you may have some side effects. These are normal signs that your body is building immunity. Your arm may hurt where you got your shot or you may have redness or swelling. You may be tired or have a headache, muscle pain, chills, fever, or nausea. &nbsp;They may affect your ability to do daily activities, but should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects. Learn more about <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html">Possible Side Effects After Getting a COVID-19 Vaccine</a>.</p>



<p>If you have experienced a side effect after COVID-19 vaccination, you can report it to:</p>



<ul><li><a class="external" href="https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html">VAERS</a> (Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System)</li><li><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html">V-safe</a> (After Vaccination Health Checker)</li></ul>



<h4 class="When to call the doctor" id="When-to-call-the-doctor">When to call the doctor</h4>



<p>In most cases, discomfort from pain or fever is a normal sign that your body is building protection. Contact your doctor or healthcare provider:</p>



<ul><li>If the redness or tenderness where you got the shot gets worse after 24 hours</li><li>If your side effects are worrying you or do not seem to be going away after a few days</li></ul>



<p>If you get a COVID-19 vaccine and you think you might be having a severe allergic reaction after leaving the vaccination site, seek immediate medical care by calling 911. Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">COVID-19 vaccines and rare severe allergic reactions</a>.</p>



<h3 id="When-you-are-fully-vaccinated">When you are fully vaccinated</h3>



<p>COVID-19 vaccines are effective at protecting you from getting sick. You can start to do some things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic.</p>



<p>See the CDC’s <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html">When You’ve Been Fully Vaccinated</a> for complete details.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator bd-top-darkblue" id="Vaccine-equity-for-hardest-hit-communities"/>



<h2>Vaccine equity for hardest-hit communities</h2>



<p>California is allocating COVID-19 vaccines as they become available to ensure equitable distribution.</p>



<p>We must end the COVID-19 pandemic as quickly and effectively as possible by vaccinating those most at risk of serious outcomes and those who have been most exposed at work or in their daily lives. This will protect not just those who are vaccinated, but reduce additional community transmission. By targeting vaccines to those who most need them, we can also begin to <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/BlueprintForSaferEconomy.aspx">safely reopen activities</a> across our economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The state will continue to double the amount of vaccine allocated to the lowest HPI quartile as <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2021/03/04/california-leads-with-public-health-and-vaccine-equity-to-safely-and-sustainably-reopen/">announced on March 4</a> for at least four weeks starting on March 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, the state<a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR21-072.aspx"> is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest-hit areas of the state</a> based on the lowest quartile of the Public Health Alliance of Southern California’s Healthy Places Index (HPI).</p>

<h2>Vaccination progress dashboards</h2>



<p>These dashboards make vaccination data transparent and accessible to all Californians. They are updated daily.</p>



<p>Early vaccinations targeted people at higher risk due to exposure, pre-existing health conditions, or age. Hence vaccinations data will reflect mostly those groups rather than mirror the overall California population.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-administration-by-county-of-residence">Vaccine administration by county of residence</h3>



<p>This dashboard reports vaccines administered by the county of residence. Statewide vaccines administered combine all the county numbers. </p>



<p>Partially-vaccinated people are those receiving only one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine. Fully-vaccinated people are those who received two doses of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines or the Janssen vaccine.</p>

<p class="small-text">Note: Doses delivered and administered do not include those delivered to and administered by the following federal agencies: Indian Health Service, Veterans Health Administration, Department of Defense, and Federal Bureau of Prisons. The CDC LTC Pharmacy and Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program doses are a subset of the doses delivered.</p>



<p class="small-text">Where the county of residence was not reported, the county where vaccinated is used. This applies to less than 1% of vaccination records. The sum of county-level vaccinations does not equal statewide total vaccinations because some out-of-state residents are vaccinated in California.</p>



<h3>Vaccination and community health conditions (Vaccine Equity Metric)</h3>



<p>These graphs compare COVID-19 vaccinations among four different levels of community health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The California Healthy Places Index (HPI), developed by the Public Health Alliance of Southern California, explores local factors that predict life expectancy and compares community conditions across the state. The HPI quartiles are the total state population divided into 25% segments based on conditions that shape health, like housing, transportation, education, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Vaccine Equity Metric (VEM) combines HPI with CDPH-derived scores. Zip codes range from less healthy community conditions in Quartile 1 to more healthy community conditions in Quartile 4.</p>

CDPH-derived quartiles should not be considered as indicative of the HPI score for these zip codes.

<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3 id="Vaccines-allocation-and-distribution">Vaccines allocation and distribution</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="Allocation">How are vaccines allocated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Using the federal allocation as a starting point, the state considers recommendations from the leadership of local health jurisdictions and the state’s third-party administrator, Blue Shield of California, to make decisions about how best to allocate vaccine supply in the state for efficient and equitable delivery of vaccinations. In addition to adjusting allocations to target eligible populations the state <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/OPA/Pages/NR21-072.aspx">is directing 40% of vaccine doses to the hardest hit areas of the state</a> based on the lowest quartile of the Healthy Places Index (HPI). See the <a class="external" href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/ca.open.data#!/vizhome/COVID-19VaccineAllocationbyLHJ/AllocationbyCounty">most recent allocation</a><strong>.</strong></p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion" id="Distribution">How are vaccines distributed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once notified of an allocation, local providers place orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider? How can providers get answers to their questions?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">See <a href="https://eziz.org/assets/other/IMM-1295.pdf">myCAvax Provider Enrollment</a> instructions for steps to sign up. Also read the CDPH’s COVID-19 vaccine provider <a class="external" href="https://eziz.org/covid/enrollment/">enrollment</a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVID-19VaccineTraining.aspx">training</a> requirements.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you are a provider looking for more information and updates on the California COVID-19 vaccination program, see the <a href="https://eziz.org/assets/docs/COVID19/Vax58ProviderFAQs.pdf">California COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider FAQs</a>.</p>



<h3 id="Getting-vaccinated">Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li><li>One dose for the Johnson &amp; Johnson/Janssen vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Be sure to get the same vaccine the second time that you got the first time. COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable with each other. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free to the public.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a class="external" href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get vaccinated against COVID-19 while I am currently sick with COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. People with COVID-19 who have symptoms should wait to be vaccinated until they have recovered from their illness and have met the <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> for ending isolation. Those without symptoms should also wait until they <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html">meet the criteria</a> before getting vaccinated. This guidance also applies to people who get COVID-19 before getting their second dose of vaccine.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will COVID-19 vaccine sites be accessible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. All vaccine clinics in California are required to ensure sites and services are accessible in accordance with ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) requirements.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get a COVID-19 vaccine at home, if I am unable to travel to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get transportation to a vaccine site?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Check with your healthcare provider, local health department, or local pharmacy.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you receive Medi-Cal through a managed care plan, contact your plan’s member service department to request assistance for transportation to receive covered benefits. If you receive Medi-Cal through Fee-for-Service (FFS), you can access a list of Non-Medical Transportation (NMT) providers in your county and you can contact them directly to arrange transportation to your appointments.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If there is not a provider in your area, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) can assist if you email them DHCSNMT@dhcs.ca.gov. Please do NOT include personal information in your first email. DHCS staff will reply with a secure email asking for your information about the appointment.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have a need for Non-Emergency Medical Transportation, please inform your medical provider who can prescribe this service and put you in touch with a transportation provider to coordinate your ride to and from your appointment(s).</p>



<h3 id="What-to-expect-after-vaccination-QA">What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What is </strong><strong>acceptable as proof of full vaccination?</strong></h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The following are accepted:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Vaccination card, which includes name of person vaccinated, type of vaccine provided, and date last dose administered&nbsp;</li><li>A photo of a vaccination card as a separate document</li><li>A photo of the attendee’s vaccination card stored on their phone</li><li>Documentation of vaccination from a healthcare provider</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a class="external" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Should I keep my COVID-19 vaccination record card?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. We urge Californians to keep their vaccination record cards for themselves and their families in a safe place to prevent loss or damage. Individuals who need replacement cards should contact their vaccination provider for replacement. The local public health department and/or CDPH may also have this information if the vaccinated individual is unable to locate it through the vaccination provider.</p>



<h3 id="Vaccine-limitations">Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna).</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction or an immediate allergic reaction to any ingredient in Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Janssen COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>If you are allergic to PEG, you should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Ask your doctor if you can get the Janssen vaccine.</li><li>If you are allergic to polysorbate, you should not get the Janssen vaccine.

People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The ingredients in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines include:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>mRNA</li><li>Lipids</li><li>Salts</li><li>Sugars</li><li>Buffers&nbsp;</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can pregnant or breastfeeding women be vaccinated against COVID-19?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html">CDC recommends</a> that if you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it’s available to you. There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may also receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. There is no routine recommendation for taking a pregnancy test before you get a COVID-19 vaccine.If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talk with a healthcare provider to help you make an informed decision.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html">CDC recommends:</a></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should wait at least 10 days since the start of COVID-19 symptoms <strong>and </strong>satisfy<strong> </strong><a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if you recovered from a COVID-19 infection and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a class="external" href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#">CDC recommends</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If a COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given within 14 days of another vaccine, you do not need to restart the COVID-19 vaccine series. You should still complete the series on schedule.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for children:</p>
