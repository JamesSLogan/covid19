<h2 id="what-smarter-stands-for">What SMARTER stands for</h2>



<p>We’re using the lessons of the last two years to prepare for future COVID-19 surges or variants.</p>



<p>SMARTER stands for:</p>



<ul><li><strong>S</strong>hots &#8211; Vaccines are our most powerful weapon against hospitalization and serious illness.</li><li><strong>M</strong>asks &#8211; Masks help slow the spread of the virus.</li><li><strong>A</strong>wareness &#8211; We will keep tracking COVID-19, communicating how to protect yourself, and coordinating state and local efforts.</li><li><strong>R</strong>eadiness &#8211; We will be ready with tools, resources, and supplies to respond to emerging situations.</li><li><strong>T</strong>esting &#8211; We will get tests to where they’re needed most.</li><li><strong>E</strong>ducation &#8211; We will work to keep schools open and kids in classrooms for in-person instruction.</li><li><strong>R</strong>x &#8211; Evolving and improved treatments will be an important tool in saving lives</li></ul>



<p>The SMARTER Plan is not just for COVID-19. We can use these strategies and systems for future emergencies. We will improve the SMARTER Plan as we learn what works.</p>



<h2 id="move-forward">How we’ll move forward</h2>



<p>COVID-19 is still here. We’ll adapt to make sure our response is the right one for future surges.</p>



<h3>Track the right data</h3>



<p>We will identify and track the right kind of data for each COVID-19 variant. We’ll use this data to determine how we’ll respond.</p>



<p>For example, if there’s a highly infectious variant that does not cause severe illness, we may focus on hospital numbers. This will help us keep our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. If there’s a variant that causes severe illness, we may track case numbers. In this case, preventing cases could save lives.</p>



<h3>Stay home when you’re sick</h3>



<p>If you test positive for COVID-19 or feel sick, stay at home.</p>



<p>If you’re exposed to someone with COVID-19:</p>



<ul><li>Consider getting tested</li><li>Wear a mask until you are sure you’re not infected</li></ul>



<h3>Adjust isolation and quarantine times based on science</h3>



<p>We will study variants to understand how long someone can infect others. Based on this data, we will adjust how long people with or suspected of having COVID-19 should stay at home.</p>



<h3>Wear masks when needed</h3>



<p>There may be times when masks will save lives. When the situation improves, we will loosen masking requirements.</p>



<h3>Take advantage of new treatments</h3>



<p>We will continue to adopt and build on innovations in healthcare, like:</p>



<ul><li>New pharmaceutical treatments</li><li>Encouraging outdoor gatherings</li><li>Improvements in telehealth</li></ul>



<h2 id="measure-success">How we’ll measure success</h2>



<p>We’ve set goals as part of the SMARTER Plan.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>Shots</td><td>Ability to administer at least <strong>200,000 vaccines per day</strong> on top of existing pharmacy and provider infrastructure</td></tr><tr><td>Masks</td><td>Maintain a stockpile of <strong>100 million high quality masks</strong> and the ability to distribute them as needed</td></tr><tr><td>Awareness</td><td>Maintain ability to promote vaccination, masking, and other mitigation measures in all <strong>58 counties</strong>. Support engagement with at least <strong>200 community based organizations</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Readiness</td><td>Have the ability to add <strong>300,000 clinical staff</strong> in <strong>2 – 3 weeks</strong> across various health care facility types</td></tr><tr><td>Testing</td><td>Maintain commercial and local public health capacity statewide to perform at least <strong>500,000 tests per day</strong> (PCR and antigen)</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Increase vaccination rates through <strong>XXXX school-based vaccination sites</strong> as eligibility expands</td></tr><tr><td>Rx</td><td>Ensure local entities can order effective therapeutics <strong>within 24 hours</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
