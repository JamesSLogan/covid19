<h2>COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</h2>



<p>Physical distancing and capacity limits for businesses and activities are over. Guidance for specific industries has ended. But employers are still responsible for maintaining safe environments for employees and customers. </p>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19. </p>



<p>Follow the California Division of Occupational Health and Safety (Cal/OSHA) COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li></ul>

<hr class="wp-block-separator" id="masking-at-work"/>



<h2>Masking at work</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx"><a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">Workers that are not fully vaccinated must wear masks indoors at work</a></a>. This is required by the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). </p>



<p>Employers must provide workers who are not fully vaccinated with masks. They must ensure they are worn over the nose and mouth when indoors and in vehicles.</p>



<p>Masks are not required outdoors regardless of vaccination status (except during outbreaks). Employers must train workers for outdoor use of masks.</p>



<p>Find complete details in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/COVID19FAQs.html#controls">face coverings section of the Cal/OSHA FAQs</a>.</p>



<h3>Providing N95 respirators</h3>



<p>Employers must provide unvaccinated workers with N95 respirators upon their request and at no cost. California is providing a one-month supply of N95 respirators to small businesses. Visit the <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/n95-distribution/">Voluntary N95 Distribution</a> page to get masks for your business.  </p>

<h2>Returning to work after getting sick or exposed to COVID-19</h2>



<p>Employers must ensure workers meet the criteria in the COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">ETS</a> before they return to work.&nbsp;When CDPH recommends shorter periods, employers must ensure workers meet the CDPH-recommended criteria.
