<h2>COVID-19 workplace safety</h2>



<p>Physical distancing and capacity limits for businesses and activities are over. Guidance for specific industries has ended. But employers are still responsible for maintaining safe environments for employees and customers.</p>



<h3>COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</h3>



<p>Employers must follow workplace safety and health regulations to protect workers. That includes protecting workers from COVID-19. Follow the COVID-19 Prevention <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) to keep your workplace safe. They cover:</p>



<ul><li>How to prevent infection in the workplace</li><li>What to do about outbreaks</li><li>How to keep employees safe in employer-provided transportation and housing</li></ul>

<h3>Masking at work</h3>



<p>Masks are required for everyone at work indoors, whether they are vaccinated or unvaccinated.

<h3>Returning to work after getting sick or exposed to COVID-19</h3>



<p>Employers must ensure workers meet the criteria in the <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">ETS</a> before they return to work.&nbsp;When CDPH recommends shorter periods, employers must ensure workers meet the recommended criteria.
