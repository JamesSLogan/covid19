            <h2>How it works</h2>
            <p>Now’s the time to call the shot. Starting on May XX, the first two million Californians to complete their COVID-19 vaccination will get a $50 incentive for Kroger, (which includes Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co.), Albertsons (which includes Safeway, Albertsons, Vons and Andronico&#8217;s Community Markets) or Virtual Mastercard®.
            </p>
            <h3>Who’s eligible</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>People who live in California</li>
                <li>People aged 12 and older</li>
                <li>People who got their vaccine starting on or after May XX (must complete vaccination)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are younger than 18, you will need to have a parent or guardian complete the incentive card selection process for you, unless you are an emancipated minor.</p>

<h2><strong>Questions and answers</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long will the You Call the Shot California program last? When will the program run out?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The program is only eligible for the first two million individuals to begin and end their vaccination process after May XX.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How is this being paid for?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program is being paid for by the State of California.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>If someone got their first shot before the incentive program started, and then get their second shot after it started, are they still eligible?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The You Call the Shot California program is only open to Californians who start their vaccination process after May XX.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Are Californians who already completed their full vaccination prior to the program eligible for the incentive card?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. This program is intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to 5 business days to receive the prepaid card. If you have not received your card after 5 business days call 1-833-993-3873.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How will people prove they’ve had both shots? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are tracked in the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) and cards will be awarded based on those records.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How do I book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can schedule appointments or view walk-in clinics at <a href="http://myturn.ca.gov">myturn.ca.gov</a> or via other resources provided by the CDC or local health departments. Appointments can also be made by calling the California COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I got the shots, but did not receive my code?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call 833-993-3873.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I get my shots outside of California’s My Turn system?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program applies to all vaccination sites in California that use their electronic health records or any site using My Turn, including vaccinations through at-home services. All providers administering COVID-19 vaccine are required to report administered doses to the state. The only clinics not eligible are federal Veterans Affairs clinics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I opted to not share my data with Information Immunization Systems (IIS)?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Is there a choice of incentive cards?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual prepaid card and can be added to a phone mobile&nbsp; wallet.</li><li>Kroger (which includes Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co.): Printing the gift card is recommended as not all grocery stores can scan the gift card.</li><li>Albertsons (which includes Safeway, Albertsons, Vons and Andronico&#8217;s Community Markets): Requires recipient to print barcode to redeem for in-store purchases.</li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Does my redemption code ever expire?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Redemption codes expire 90 days after you&nbsp; receive it. The incentive cards themselves have different expiration dates. The Virtual Mastercard® expires after 12 months of receipt. The Kroger or Albertsons card never expires.</p>
