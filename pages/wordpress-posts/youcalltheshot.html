<h2><strong>Questions and answers</strong></h2>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long will the You Call the Shot CA program last? When will the program run out?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The program is only eligible for the first two million individuals to begin and end their vaccination process after May 24.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How is this being paid for?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program is being paid for by the State of California.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>If someone got their first shot before the incentive program started, and then get their second shot after it started, are they still eligible?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The You Call the Shot California program is only open to Californians who start their vaccination process after May 24.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Are Californians who already completed their full vaccination prior to the program eligible for the gift card?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. This program is intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated before the state fully reopens on June 15.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Isn’t this program rewarding bad behavior by giving cash to people who waited?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. We understand that some people werenot ready to get the COVID-19 vaccine on day one. That’s okay. Science shows the COVID-19 vaccine is our best tool for ending this pandemic, and we’re thrilled to be able to launch a program designed to motivate people who need an extra incentive to get vaccinated and help California stay safe.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How long after redeeming the card does it take to receive it?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to 5 business days to receive the prepaid card. If you have not received your card after 5 business days call 1-833-993-3873.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How will people prove they’ve had both shots? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All vaccines are tracked in the California Immunization Registry (CAIR) and cards will be awarded based on those records.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>How do I book a COVID-19 vaccination appointment?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can schedule appointments or view walk-in clinics at myturn.ca.gov or via other resources provided by the CDC or local health departments. Appointments can also be made by calling the California COVID-19 Hotline at 1-833-422-4255.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I got the shots, but did not receive my code?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call 833-993-3873.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I get my shots outside of California’s My Turn system?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This program applies to all vaccination sites in California that use their electronic health records or any site using My Turn, including vaccinations administered in-home. All providers administering COVID-19 vaccine are required to report administered doses to the state. The only clinics not eligible are federal Veterans Affairs clinics.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>What if I opted to not share my data with Information Immunization Systems (IIS)?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The data is still reported to the state, so you would still be eligible for the incentive.</p>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Can I choose between gift cards?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard: This is not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. This card is digital and can be added to a phone wallet.</li><li>Kroger Grocery Stores (also good at Fry’s, Food 4 Less, and Foods Co.): It’s recommended, but not required that you print this card out.</li><li>Albertsons/Safeway (also good at Vons and Andronico’s Community Markets). It’s recommended, but not required that you print this card out.</li></ol>



<h3 class="wp-accordion"><strong>Does my gift card redemption code ever expire?</strong></h3>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. Redemption codes expire 90 days after you  receive it. The prepaid cards themselves have different expiration dates. The Virtual Mastercard expires after 12 months of receipt and the Kroger and Albertsons /Safeway prepaid card never expires.</p>
