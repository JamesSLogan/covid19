<p>California has a blueprint for reducing COVID-19 in the state with revised criteria for loosening and tightening restrictions on activities.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Understand your county&#8217;s status</h2>



<p>Every county in California is assigned to a tier based on its positivity rate, adjusted case rate, and health equity metric. Counties must remain in a tier for at least 3 weeks before moving to a less restrictive tier. Data is reviewed weekly and tiers are updated on Tuesdays. To move to a less restrictive tier, a county must meet the next tier’s criteria for two consecutive weeks. If a county’s metrics worsen for two consecutive weeks, it will be assigned a more restrictive tier. Read more about <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">tier assignment rules</a>.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Reopening safely for all communities</h3>



<p>COVID-19 has impacted some communities more than others. They face higher rates of infection and death. These include our Latino, Black, Pacific Islander, low income, and essential worker communities.</p>



<h4 class="has-text-align-left">Health equity metric</h4>



<p>Counties must address COVID-19 in <strong>all</strong> communities to open further, including making sure the positivity rate in certain neighborhoods (health equity metric) does not significantly lag behind overall county positivity rates. These efforts need cross-sector and broad partnerships to succeed. The health equity metric is only used to decide whether a county can move to a less restrictive tier. Learn more about this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/CaliforniaHealthEquityMetric.aspx" target="_blank">focus on equity</a>.</p>



<h4 class="has-text-align-left">Vaccine equity metric</h4>



<p>Ending the COVID-19 pandemic quickly and effectively requires vaccinating those most at risk. To do so, we’re setting aside 40% of vaccines to distribute to the hardest-hit communities. This approach will help lower the rate of community infection, hospitalizations, and deaths, as well as reduce potential new variants that might emerge with each new case. This is the most equitable and impactful way to distribute our still-limited vaccine supply to end this pandemic.</p>



<p>We’ve set an immediate goal of reaching 2 million vaccine doses administered to the hardest-hit communities in the state, representing about 25% of eligible Californians. When these 2 million vaccine doses have been administered, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy tiers will be updated to allow for somewhat higher case rates. Learn more about these upcoming changes the CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/COVID19CountyMonitoringOverview.aspx">Blueprint for a Safer Economy framework</a>.</p>

*Small counties (those with a population less than 106,000) may be subject to alternate case assessment measures for purposes of tier assignment.</br>
**Health equity metric is not applied for small counties. The health equity metric is used to move to a less restrictive tier.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center">Regional Stay Home Order</h3>



<p>The CA Department of Public Health ended the Regional Stay Home Order across California. This action came as projected ICU availability rose above 15%. Counties have returned to their assigned Blueprint tiers and are urged to continue safe practices, avoiding crowds and wearing a mask when leaving home.</p>



<h3 class="has-text-align-center" id="county-status">Current tier assignments as of {{_varTierDate_}}</h3>



<p>Data is reviewed weekly and tiers are updated on Tuesdays. At a minimum, counties must remain in a tier for at least 3 weeks before moving to a less restrictive tier. Counties must meet the next tier’s criteria for two consecutive weeks to move to a less restrictive tier.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-center">Questions and answers</h2>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Why can some activities and businesses open while others have to stay closed?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Activities and businesses that have a lower risk of spreading COVID-19 are allowed to open sooner. Higher-risk activities or businesses aren’t allowed until later tiers. An activity or business’s tier depends on whether it can:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Accommodate mask wearing at all times (for example, eating and drinking requires removing masks)</li><li>Allow physical distance between individuals from different households</li><li>Limit the number of people per square foot</li><li>Limit time that an individual is at the business or activity</li><li>Limit time of exposure</li><li>Limit mixing of people from different households</li><li>Limit amount of physical interactions of visitors/patrons</li><li>Increase airflow (such as operating outdoors or opening windows and doors)&nbsp;</li><li>Limit activities that are known to increase virus spread (like singing, shouting and heavy breathing)</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What happened to the County Monitoring List?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">On August 31, the Blueprint for a Safer Economy replaced the County Data Monitoring List for determining what business can and cannot open.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">So why change? We learned a lot over the first several months of the pandemic about COVID-19 and how it spreads. For example, we know how much safer outdoor activities are than indoor ones and that it’s critical everyone wears a mask to limit the spread of the disease. This blueprint incorporates what we’ve learned.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The Blueprint for a Safer Economy is the next evolution of our response. We’ve revised the criteria and the time between changing tiers. We&#8217;ve made it easy for counties to see how changes affect the disease’s trajectory and for businesses and customers to plan ahead. And we’ve given Californians one place to look up whether a business or activity is allowed near them.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What happens if my county’s case rate and positivity measures fall into two different tiers?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If a county’s case rate and positivity rate fall into different tiers, the county remains in the stricter tier.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can my school open under the Blueprint for a Safer Economy?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All K-6 grade schools are able to open for in-person instruction if the county case rate is below 25 per 100,000 and their plan for reopening is approved by county health officials or the State Safe Schools Team. All schools are able to open for in-person instruction if the county is in the red, orange or yellow tiers.&nbsp; Learn more about <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH%20Document%20Library/COVID-19/Consolidated_Schools_Guidance.pdf">guidance for schoolsPDF</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">All public schools must offer in-person instruction under the <a href="http://cert1.mail-west.com/7Jyj7W/uzjanmc7rm/k36817Jgtmy/0gk2q/qvnq7Jddykx/817J/qo3iy3h2k1i56alg?_c=d%7Cze7pzanwmhlzgt%7C1865v1x2u3lv3bd&amp;_ce=1614969307.2f0bcbf94cf0f1ef3b6c085fb9534889">COVID-19 relief and school reopening relief package</a> for K-2 grades and students with high needs. Schools that do not offer in-person instruction for these groups by March 31, 2021 will lose 1 percent of eligible funds every day thereafter.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Schools in the Substantial (red) tier or better are required to offer in-person instruction to all students in all elementary grades and at least one middle or high school grade, or risk the same funding penalty.</p>

<h4 class="wp-accordion">What can I do to help my county reach a lower tier?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Stay home except for essential needs.</li><li>Wear a mask in public.</li><li>Wash your hands regularly.</li><li>Keep at least six feet of physical distance when in public.</li><li>Limit mixing with people you don’t live with.</li><li><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/vaccines/">Get vaccinated</a>.</li></ul>
