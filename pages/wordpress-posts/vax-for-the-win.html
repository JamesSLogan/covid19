<p>For rules, eligibility, and more details, see <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Vax-Win-Terms.aspx">Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long will the incentive cards last? When will the program run out?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Cards were only available for the first 2 million eligible individuals who started their vaccination process between May 27 and July 18, 2021. The program ended January 7, 2022.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">If I got my first dose before the incentive card program started, then get my second dose after it started, am I eligible?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, you were not eligible to receive an incentive card. But you were eligible for the other cash and vacation prizes. The purpose of the card program was to motivate unvaccinated Californians to get vaccinated.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get the $50 incentive card if I completed my vaccination before the program started?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. The incentive card program was intended to motivate the remaining Californians to get vaccinated. However, fully vaccinated Californians were eligible for other cash and vacation prizes.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How do I get my redemption code?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you started your vaccination between May 27 and July 18, 2021, you got a redemption code by text or email within 7-10 days after your last vaccination. For those receiving a two-dose series, your $50 card was set aside until your completed second dose.</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you do not have a mobile phone or email address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, you can call <a href="tel:1-833-993-3873">1-833-993-3873</a> to receive a physical card.</li><li>If you don’t have a permanent address, then 7-10 days after your vaccination, call <a href="tel:1-833-993-3873">1-833-993-3873</a> to coordinate delivery of your $50 card.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long after redeeming the incentive card does it take to receive it?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It takes up to five business days to receive the incentive card. If you have not received your card after five business days, call <a href="tel:1-833-993-3873">1-833-993-3873</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How will people prove they’ve had both doses? What if someone tries to cheat with a fake vaccine card?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">COVID-19 vaccines are tracked in California immunization records. Incentive cards and other cash prizes will be awarded based on those records.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I got vaccinated, but did not receive my code?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you do not receive a code after 14 days, call <a href="tel:1-833-993-3873">1-833-993-3873</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is there a choice of incentive cards?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes, there are three choices:</p>



<ol class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Virtual Mastercard®: Not an ATM card so it cannot be cashed out. It can be redeemed online where Debit Mastercard® is accepted. This is a virtual incentive card and can be added to a phone mobile wallet.</li><li>Kroger: Good at Ralphs, Food 4 Less and Foods Co. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone. <em>(Note: Some Food 4 Less stores in Northern California and the Central Coast do not accept this card as payment. <em>Check this </em><a href="https://files.covid19.ca.gov/pdf/Ralphs-Food4Less-FoodsCo-CA-list.pdf"><em>list of participating Kroger locations</em></a><em>.</em>)</em></li><li>Albertsons: Good at Safeway, Albertsons, Vons, Pavilions, and Andronico's Community Markets. We recommend printing the card, as not all grocery stores can scan it on a phone.</li></ol>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Available while supplies last. If you are younger than 18, you will need to have a parent or guardian complete the card selection process for you, unless you are an emancipated minor.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Does my redemption code ever expire?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. You must use the redemption code by January 7, 2022. Once claimed, the Virtual Mastercard® expires after 12 months. The grocery cards never expire.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What did I need to do to enter the drawings?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You just had to get vaccinated in California for COVID-19 before winners were drawn. No entry form was needed; you were automatically entered in the drawing based on California immunization records once your vaccinator provided the state vaccination registry with your information. Vaccinations counted whether you got the Pfizer, Moderna, or Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine. You must be living in California to win. Winner gets the prize after they complete their vaccination series.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What if I get vaccinated outside of California’s My Turn system?</h4>
