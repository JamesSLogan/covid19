<h3>In the workplace</h3>



<p>Cal/OSHA has aligned workplace mask requirements in its <a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html">COVID-19 Prevention Emergency Temporary Standards</a> (ETS) with <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/guidance-for-face-coverings.aspx">mask requirements</a> from the California Department of Public Health:</p>



<ul><li>No face covering requirements outdoors (except during outbreaks), regardless of vaccination status, though workers should be trained for outdoor use of face coverings.</li><li>Employers may allow fully vaccinated employees not to wear face coverings indoors, but must document their vaccination status. There are some settings where masks are required regardless of vaccination status. In outbreaks, all employees must wear face coverings indoors and outdoors when six-feet physical distancing cannot be maintained, regardless of vaccination status.</li><li>Employers must provide unvaccinated employees with <a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/n95-distribution/"><a href="https://saferatwork.covid19.ca.gov/n95-distribution/">approved</a></a> respirators for voluntary use when working indoors or in a vehicle with others, upon request.</li></ul>
