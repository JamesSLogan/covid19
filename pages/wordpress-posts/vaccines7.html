<h2 id="Questions-and-answers">Questions and answers</h2>



<h3>Vaccination planning</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How are vaccines allocated?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Once a week, the federal government announces anticipated allocation figures for each state. The number of allocated doses provided by the federal government is a projection and subject to change. Local providers are required to place their orders which are reviewed by the state and submitted to the federal government. The federal government then authorizes the order and submits the request to the manufacturer. The manufacturer or central distributor ships the vaccine directly to local providers. It can take a week or longer for allocation by the federal government to arrive at public health offices or providers for administration.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How can I sign-up to be a COVID-19 vaccine provider?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Initial enrollment in the vaccination program is limited to sites selected by local health departments. Enrollment will open up to other providers as vaccine supply increases.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Providers enrolling in the program must be <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/Authorized-Licensees.aspx">credentialed/licensed</a> in the jurisdiction where vaccination takes place, complete all <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/COVID-19VaccineTraining.aspx">required training</a>, and comply with federal and state requirements.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content"><a href="https://eziz.org/covid/enrollment/">Find out more about the enrollment process and program requirements</a>.</p>



<h3>Getting vaccinated</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How many COVID-19 vaccine doses are needed?</h4>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Two doses for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, 21 days apart</li><li>Two doses for the Moderna vaccine, 28 days apart</li><li>One dose for the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If two shots are required, <strong><strong>get your second shot as close to the recommended interval as possible</strong></strong>,<strong> </strong>but not sooner. However, if you can’t get it at the recommended interval, second doses may be given up to 6 weeks (42 days) after the first dose. There is limited data on how well these vaccines work beyond this window. But if the second dose is given after 42 days, there is no need to start over.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Be sure to get the same COVID-19 vaccine the second time that you got the first time. These vaccines are not interchangeable with each other or with other COVID-19 vaccines. The safety and efficacy of mixing vaccines has not been tested.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How much will the COVID-19 vaccine cost?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Nothing. COVID-19 vaccines, including their administration, are free.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at the Department of Managed Health Care’s <a href="https://www.dmhc.ca.gov/Portals/0/Docs/DO/VaccineFactSheetAccessible.pdf">Know Your Health Care Rights</a>.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Do I need to be a California resident to get COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. Vaccine distribution is based on eligibility irrespective of residency or immigration status.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I’ve already had COVID-19. Should I get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. At this time, we do not know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19.</p>



<h3>What to expect after vaccination</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will the COVID-19 vaccine make me test positive for COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No. A vaccine will not cause you to test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/diagnostic-testing.html">viral tests</a>.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If your body develops an immune response (the goal of vaccination), there is a possibility that you may test positive on <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing/serology-overview.html">antibody tests</a>. Antibody tests indicate that you may have protection against the virus.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is my privacy protected if I take the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California law strictly limits how personal information about those who are vaccinated can be shared. California negotiated with the federal government to limit the required data sharing to only information that will not allow an individual to be identified.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Read more at CDPH’s <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/California-Data-Use-Agreement.aspx">California Data Use Agreement and Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</p>



<h3>Vaccine limitations</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">I have allergies. Should I get the COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have ever had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in a COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that specific vaccine.</li><li>If you have a severe allergic reaction after getting the first shot, you should not get the second shot.</li><li>If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>People who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to other vaccines or injections, you should ask your doctor if you should get a COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>People with a history of severe allergic reactions not related to vaccines or injections may still get vaccinated. People may get vaccinated even with a:<ul><li>History of allergies to oral medications</li><li>Family history of severe allergic reactions</li><li>Milder allergy to vaccines</li></ul></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">What are the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The ingredients in currently available COVID-19 vaccines include mRNA, lipids, salts, sugars, and buffers. Buffers help maintain the stability of the pH solution. Vaccine ingredients can vary by manufacturer. To learn more about the ingredients in authorized COVID-19 vaccines, see</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html">Information about the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</a></li><li><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Moderna.html">Information about the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine</a></li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are there certain populations who should not get a COVID-19 vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">CDC recommends</a> that:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you have had a severe allergic reaction to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had a severe allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.</li><li>If you have had an immediate allergic reaction—even if it was not severe—to any ingredient in an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get either of the currently available mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.</li><li>If you had an immediate allergic reaction after getting the first dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get the second dose.&nbsp; Your doctor may refer you to a specialist in allergies and immunology to provide more care or advice.</li><li>People who are allergic to polyethylene glycol (PEG) or polysorbate should not get an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People with underlying medical conditions can receive the FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines provided they have not had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/allergic-reaction.html">an immediate or severe allergic reaction</a> to a COVID-19 vaccine or to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Learn more about vaccination <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/underlying-conditions.html">considerations for people with underlying medical conditions.</a> Vaccination is an important consideration for adults of any age with certain underlying medical conditions because they are at increased risk for severe illness from the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can pregnant or breastfeeding women be vaccinated against COVID-19?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Yes. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/pregnancy.html">CDC recommends</a> that if you are pregnant, you may choose to be vaccinated when it’s available to you. There is currently no evidence that antibodies formed from COVID-19 vaccination cause any problem with pregnancy, including the development of the placenta.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">People who are trying to become pregnant now or who plan to try in the future may also receive the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them. There is no evidence that fertility problems are a side effect of any vaccine, including COVID-19 vaccines. There is no routine recommendation for taking a pregnancy test before you get a COVID-19 vaccine.If you have questions about getting vaccinated, talk with a healthcare provider to help you make an informed decision.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How long should I wait to get the vaccine after I had COVID-19?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/clinical-considerations.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fvaccines%2Fcovid-19%2Finfo-by-product%2Fpfizer%2Fclinical-considerations.html">CDC recommends:</a></p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>If you tested positive, had only mild symptoms, and were not treated for the coronavirus, you should wait at least 10 days since the start of COVID-19 symptoms <strong>and </strong>satisfy<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html">criteria</a> to discontinue isolation before getting the COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>Wait 90 days to get the vaccine if you recovered from a COVID-19 infection and were treated with monoclonal antibodies or convalescent plasma.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Can I get a COVID-19 vaccine at the same time as another vaccine?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/faq.html#">CDC recommends</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Wait at least 14 days before getting any other vaccine, including a flu or shingles vaccine, if you get your COVID-19 vaccine first. And if you get another vaccine first, wait at least 14 days before getting your COVID-19 vaccine.</li><li>If a COVID-19 vaccine is inadvertently given within 14 days of another vaccine, you do not need to restart the COVID-19 vaccine series; you should still complete the series on schedule. When more data are available on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines administered simultaneously with other vaccines, the CDC may update this recommendation.</li></ul>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Is the COVID-19 vaccine safe for children?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Currently, COVID-19 vaccines are not recommended for children:</p>



<ul class="wp-accordion-content"><li>Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is for ages sixteen and above</li><li>Moderna vaccine is for ages eighteen and above</li><li>Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine is for ages eighteen and above</li></ul>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Clinical trials are ongoing to identify a safe vaccine for children.</p>



<h3>Vaccine choices</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Will I have a choice between the various COVID-19 vaccines?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">It depends. Check with your health care provider about which vaccine they have available.</p>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">Are the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory?&nbsp;</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">No, there is no mandatory vaccination requirement from either the state or federal government.&nbsp; Once more and more Californians see how safe and effective the COVID-19 vaccines are, we hope they will voluntarily opt to receive them.</p>



<h3>Vaccine committees and workgroups</h3>



<h4 class="wp-accordion">How is the state making vaccine decisions?</h4>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">A <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Drafting-Guidelines-Workgroup.aspx/">group of experts</a> and a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Community-Vaccine-Advisory-Committee.aspx/">group of community representatives</a> work together to make sure vaccine distribution is prioritized fairly.&nbsp;</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">California formed a <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Scientific-Safety-Review-Workgroup.aspx">Scientific Safety Review Workgroup</a> of experts to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. This workgroup has confirmed that the COVID-19 vaccines authorized by the FDA are safe and effective.</p>
