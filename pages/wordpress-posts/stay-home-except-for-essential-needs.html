<p class="emphasized">California is moving Beyond the Blueprint and safely, fully reopening the economy on June 15 â€“ no more physical distancing, no more capacity limits on businesses, no more county tiers, and relaxed mask guidance.</p>



<h2>Restrictions that are changing</h2>



<p>As of June 15, 2021, the Governor is terminating the executive orders that put into place the <a href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/3.19.20-attested-EO-N-33-20-COVID-19-HEALTH-ORDER.pdf">Stay Home Order</a> and the <a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy/">Blueprint for a Safer Economy</a>. He is also phasing out the vast majority of executive actions put in place since March 2020 as part of the pandemic response, leaving in place a handful of provisions that facilitate the ongoing recovery.</p>



<p>The public health officer has issued a new <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Order-of-the-State-Public-Health-Officer-Beyond-Blueprint.aspx">public health order</a> effective June 15, superseding all prior health orders. The new order has limited restrictions, only related to masking and mega-events, as well as settings serving children and youth pending an expected update to the K-12 schools guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>



<p>The public health officer has also issued new guidance on masks that is effective on June 15, and he will end the <a href="https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/Travel-Advisory.aspx">Travel Advisory</a>.</p>
