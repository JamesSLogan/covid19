<p class="wp-accordion">How do I sign up?</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can sign up directly with a broadband provider once the program starts. To see which broadband providers will offer discounts in your community, enter your address below. (idea of what this could be: <a href="https://www.alpha.ca.gov/find-food-banks-near-you/">food bank search</a>)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion">How long with this program last?  </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a temporary program and federal government is only paying for these discounts until the money for the program is spent or the pandemic has ended. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your broadband provider will tell you right away if the program is ending and your provider will provide options for other low-cost broadband programs, if they are available. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your broadband service will end unless you let your broadband provider know that you want to continue paying for a more expensive broadband plan once the program ends. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion">How do I get more questions answered or tell you what I think about the program? </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Let us know your questions and we&#8217;ll add them to our list here. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">If you have comments or ideas about the program, we&#8217;d like to hear them. The federal government made the rules for this program, and we want to make sure it works well for Californians.</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">The federal government has also published a lot of information about the Emergency Broadband Benefit. Here is their <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumer-faq-emergency-broadband-benefit">list of commonly asked questions</a>.</p>
