<p class="wp-accordion">How do I sign up?</p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">You can sign up directly with a broadband provider once the program starts. To see which broadband providers will offer discounts in your community, enter your address below. (idea of what this could be: <a href="https://www.alpha.ca.gov/find-food-banks-near-you/">food bank search</a>)</p>



<p class="wp-accordion">How long with this program last?  </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">This is a temporary program and federal government is only paying for these discounts until the money for the program is spent or the pandemic has ended. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your broadband provider will tell you right away if the program is ending and your provider will provide options for other low-cost broadband programs, if they are available. </p>



<p class="wp-accordion-content">Your broadband service will end unless you let your broadband provider know that you want to continue paying for a more expensive broadband plan once the program ends. </p>
